## 🧠 High-Level Architecture

Microsoft Cloud is built in **layers**, not isolated services:

* **Identity & Access** → Microsoft Entra ID
* **Productivity & Collaboration** → Microsoft 365
* **Infrastructure & Apps** → Azure
* **Device Management** → Intune
* **Security & Threat Detection** → Microsoft Defender
* **Cloud Security Posture** → Defender for Cloud
* **DevOps & Automation** → Azure DevOps

Understanding these layers makes monitoring and security far more effective.
